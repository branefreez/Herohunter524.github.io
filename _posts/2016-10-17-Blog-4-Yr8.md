    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We started by asking simple questions(e.g. What's your name?)</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To understand the code and how to use it to store info</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes I reached my target, as I am now confident in this area of coding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt that to be able to use commands to create information on someone, you would need to create variables, e.g. Age, Name. I tried to use logic when typing the code, to see if I could figure out what the code was going to execute.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that nothing really in this lesson limited my learning as my partner and I worked effectively in our time limit, and got a decent amount of work completed.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think I can improve my learning by working a little more quickly, so that we are aiming to complete around 1 section every lesson.</td>
